# Drumbadum

This is the code for developing the Fools drum machine on the pc. By executing `./run.sh`, you run the program for 10 seconds and output a .wav file of the audio. When happy with the code, it is transferred to the drumbdadum-STM32 [repo](https://github.com/mjoes/drumbadum-stm32) for flashing onto the STM32 microcontroller.
